ROCK OF AGES

        1   4           1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
       1/5  5          1
Let me hide  myself in Thee;
        5             1
Let the water and the blood,
         5                  1      4
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
      1       4       1
Be of sin the  double cure;
          1/5 5              1
Save from wrath  and made me pure.


        1     4      1
Not the labor  of my hands
       1/5  5             1
Can fulfill   Thy lawâ€™s demands;
         5               1
Could my zeal no respite know,
         5             1     4
Could my tears forever flow,
        1         4     1
All for sin could  not atone;
          1/5 5           1
Thou must save, and Thou alone.


        1     4      1
Nothing in my hand I bring,
       1/5  5          1
Simply to the  cross I cling;
       5                1
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
         5                 1     4
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
        1      4         1
Foul, I to the  fountain fly;
         1/5 5           1
Wash me, Savior, or I die.


        1         4         1
While I draw this  fleeting breath,
          1/5 5               1
When mine eyes shall close in death,
       5              1
When I soar to worlds unknown,
         5               1          4
See thee on thy judgment throne,
        1   4           1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
       1/5 5           1
Let me hide  myself in thee.
