Fill thou my life, O Lord, my God

   4     5         1
In every part with praise

     1        5     2-     6-
That my whole being may proclaim

    4     5       1
Thy being and Thy ways

    2-             3-
Not for the lip of praise alone

    4
Nor e'en the praising heart

  1        5     2-        6-
I ask, but for a life made up

   4         5     1
Of praise in every part


       1      5      2-        6-
Praise in the common things of life

    4      5       1
Its goings out and in

       1       5    2-       6-
Praise in each duty and each deed

   4    5         1
However small and mean

     2-            3-
Fill every part of me with praise

    4
Let all my being speak

   1        5      2-      6-
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord

     4        5       1
Poor though I be, and weak



   1           5          2-       6-
So shalt Thou, Lord, from me, e'en me

   4        5     1
Receive the glory due

    1        5   2-     6-
And so shall I begin on earth

    4       5    1
The song forever new

   2-               3-
So shall no part of day or night

     4
From sacredness be free

    1      5        2-    6-
But all my life, in every step

   4     5         1
Be fellowship with Thee
