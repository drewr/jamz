ALL I HAVE IS CHRIST q = 76 
 

           5               6-
I once was lost in darkest night

              4        6-
Yet thought I knew the way

             2-               4
The sin that promised joy and life

           5      1
Had led me to the grave

         1/3                 4
I had no hope that You would own

        2-      6-
A rebel to Your will

           1/3              4
And if You had not loved me first

          6-       5
I would refuse You still



         5                 6-
But as I ran my hell bound race 

  1/3       4      6-
Indifferent to the cost

            2-              4
You looked upon my helpless state

           5       1 
And led me to the cross

        1/3               4
And I beheld God’s love displayed

             2-    6-
You suffered in my place

             1/3                4
You bore the wrath reserved for me

          6-      5
Now all I know is grace! 



     4    1         5       6-
Hallelu - jah all I have is Christ

     4    6-        5     1
Hallelu - jah Jesus is my life  
 
 

           5               6-
Now Lord I would be Yours alone

            4         1
And live so all might see

                2-            4
The strength to follow Your commands

            5         1
Could never come from me

         1/3             4
O Father use my ransomed life

       2-       6-
In any way You choose

           1/3          4
And let my song forever be

        6-       5
My only boast is You
