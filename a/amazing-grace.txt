AMAZING GRACE

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound!
                         5
That saved a wretch like me!
  1                 4      1
I once was lost but now am found,
    6-         5     1     5sus
Was blind, but now I see.


      1                    4        1
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
                      5
And Grace, my fears relieved.
    1                 4      1
How precious did that Grace appear
    6-     5       1
The hour I first believed.


    1                 4       1
The Lord has promised good to me.
                   5
His word my hope secures.
   1                  4       1
He will my shield and portion be
   6-      5      1
As long as life endures.


     1                   4        1
When we've been here ten thousand years
                      5
Bright shining as the sun,
      1               4          1
We've no less days to sing God's praise
     6-         5       1
Than when we've first begun.










Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.
