AMAZING GRACE

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound!
                         5
That saved a wretch like me!
  1                 4      1
I once was lost but now am found,
    6-         5     1     5sus
Was blind, but now I see.


      1                    4        1
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
                      5
And Grace, my fears relieved.
    1                 4      1
How precious did that Grace appear
    6-     5       1
The hour I first believed.

The Lord has promised good to me.
                   5
His word my hope secures.
   1                  4       1
He will my shield and portion be
   6-      5      1
As long as life endures.


     1                   4        1
When we've been here ten thousand years
                      5
Bright shining as the sun,
      1               4          1
We've no less days to sing God's praise
     6-         5       1
Than when we've first begun.
