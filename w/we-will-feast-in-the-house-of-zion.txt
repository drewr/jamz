WE WILL FEAST IN THE HOUSE OF ZION

1       6-           4        1  1/7
We will feast in the house of Zion
6- 5    4    1/3      2-       5
We will sing with our hearts restored
       1          6-              4     1     1/7
He has done great things, we will say together

We will feast and   weep  no  more

               4             6-
We will not be burned by the fire
   4      5        6-
He is the LORD our God
              4             6-
We are not consumed, by the flood
  4        5       4/6      5/7
Upheld, protected, gathered up

CHORUS

               4                 6-
In the dark of night, before the dawn
   4        5    6-
My soul, be not afraid
                 4               6-
For the promised morning, oh how long?
   4      5      4/6   5/7
Oh God of Jacob, be my strength

CHORUS

                4            6-
Every vow we've broken and betrayed
    4       5        6-
You are the Faithful one
             4             6-
And from the garden to the grave
     4    5       4/6      5/7
Bind us together, bring shalom

CHORUS
