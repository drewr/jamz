WE WILL FEAST IN THE HOUSE OF ZION

1       6-           4        1  1/7
We will feast in the house of Zion
6- 1/5  4    1/3      2-       5
We will sing with our hearts restored
       1          6-              4     1     1/7
He has done great things, we will say together
6- 1/5  4     1/3   2-    5   1
We will feast and   weep  no  more

               4             6-
We will not be burned by the fire
   4      5        6-
He is the LORD our God
              4             6-
We are not consumed, by the flood
  4        5       4/6      5/7
Upheld, protected, gathered up

In the dark of night, before the dawn
My soul, be not afraid
For the promised morning, oh how long?
Oh God of Jacob, be my strength

Every vow we've broken and betrayed
You are the Faithful one
And from the garden to the grave
Bind us together, bring shalom
