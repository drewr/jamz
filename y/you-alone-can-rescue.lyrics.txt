YOU ALONE CAN RESCUE

Who, oh Lord, could save themselves;
Their own soul could heal?
Our shame was deeper than the sea.
Your grace is deeper still.

You alone can rescue. You alone can save.
You alone can lift us from the grave.
You came down to find us; led us out of death.
To You alone belongs the highest praise!

You, oh Lord, have made a way;
The great divide you healed.
For when our hearts were far away
Your love went further still.
Yes, your love goes further still!
