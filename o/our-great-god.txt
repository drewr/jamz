Hallelu - jah! Glory be to our great God! (x2)



Lord, we are weak and frail, helpless in the storm

Surround us with your angels, hold us in your arms

Our cold and ruthless enemy, his pleasure is our harm

Rise up, oh Lord, and he will flee before our Sovereign God


Let every creature in the sea and every flying bird

Let every mountain, every field and valley of the earth

Let all the moons and all the stars in all the universe

Sing praises to the living God, who rules them by His word
