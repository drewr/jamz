PSALM 130

         1               5                 6-            4
From the depths of woe I raise to Thee the voice of lamentation,
      1               5             6-            4
Lord, turn a gracious ear to me and hear my supplication,
   4          5                 6-              4
If Thou iniquity doest mark our secret sins and misdeeds dark
  1         5       4                       5
O who shall stand before Thee? (O who shall stand before Thee...)
  1         5       4                       5
O who shall stand before Thee? (Who shall stand...)


   1             5                     6-           4
To wash away the crimson stain, grace, grace alone availeth,
    1              5               6-                 4
Our works alas are all in vain; in much the best life faileth
   4             5                 6-            4
No man can glory in Thy sight, all must alike confess Thy might
    1     5       4                5
And live alone by mercy (And live alone by mercy)
    1     5       4
And live alone by mercy (and live alone...)


     1                 5               6-              4
Therefore, my trust is in the Lord and not in mine own merit
   1                5                6-                4
On Him my soul will rest; His word upholds my fainting spirit,
    4              5              6-             4
His promised mercy is my fort, my comfort and my sweet support,
  1        5       4                    5
I wait for it with patience (I wait for it with patience)
  1        5       4
I wait for it with patience (wait for it...)

     1                 1Maj7             1M7            4
What though I wait the live long night until the dawn appeareth
   1                    1Maj7            1M7              4
My heart still trusteth in his might, it doubteth not nor feareth,
   4             5                 6-            4
Do Thus, O ye of Israel's seed, ye of the Spirit born indeed
    1        5    4                      5
And wait til God appeareth (And wait til God appeareth
    1        5    4
And wait til God appeareth (wait til God...)


    1                  5                  6-               4
Tho great our sins and sore our woes, His grace much more aboundeth,
    1                5                6-             4
His helping love, no limit knows, our utmost need it soundeth
    4                 5               6-               4
Our shepherd good and true is He, Who will at last His Israel free
     1         5       4                        5
From all their sin and sorrow	(from all their sin and sorrow) (repeats)
