C                               F C
  I've been trying to do it right

C                              F C
  I've been living a lonely life

C                               F C
  I've been sleeping here instead

C                            
  I've been sleeping in my bed,

Am         G         C
  Sleeping in my bed



C                  F C
  So show me family

C                                 F C
  All the blood that I would bleed

C                             F C
  I don't know where I belong

C                                F C
  I don't know where I went wrong

Am         G               C
  But I can write a song


                  Am
I belong with you

                   G
You belong with me

                 C
You're my sweet - heart

                  Am
I belong with you

                   G
You belong with me

                 C
You're my sweet...


F C repeat


C                                    F  C
  I don't think you're right for him.

C                                 F  C
  Look at what it might have been... If you

C                          F  C
  Took a bus to China Town.

C
  I'd be standing on Canal

Am       G         C
  And Bo - wery.

Am                      G            C
 And she'd be standing next to me.



F           G      C
Love â€“ we need it now

       F        G      / / /
Let's hope for some

F          G       C
So, we're bleeding out




                  Am
I belong with you

                   G
You belong with me

                 C
You're my sweet - heart

                  Am
I belong with you

                   G
You belong with me

                 C
You're my sweet...
