HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE


    1                 2-   1/3  4
How deep the Father's love for  us,

    1/3             6-    5
How vast beyond all mea - sure

     1                  2-   1/3  4
That He should give His on - ly   Son

   1/5               5    1
To make a wretch His treasure



    1/3               6-    5    4
How great the pain of sea - ring loss,

    1/3              6-    5
The Father turns His face away

   1                    2-    1/3  4
As wounds which mar the cho - sen  One,

      1/5          5     1
Bring many sons to glo - ry



Behold the Man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished



I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE

How deep the Father's love for us,
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One,
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom
