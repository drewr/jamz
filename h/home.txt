Hold on,     to me as we go

      C          Csus                C     Csus
As we roll down      this unfamiliar road

                  Am             F              C    Csus
And although this wave (wave) is stringing us along

     C    G/B    Am  G   Am
Just know you're not a - lone

                F    C/E  Dm7   G    C
Cause I'm gonna make this place your home




C           Csus             C         Csus
Settle down,    it'll all be clear

C                        Csus
Don't pay no mind to the demons

                   C          Csus
They fill you with fear

    Am                        F
The trouble it might drag you down

           C                       G
If you get lost, you can always be found

     C    G/B    Am  G   Am
Just know you're not a - lone

                F    C/E  Dm7   G    C
Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
