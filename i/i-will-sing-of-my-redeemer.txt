I WILL SING OF MY REDEEMER


1              4            1               1/5       5
I will sing of my Redeemer, He who took the nails for me
1                    4                   1                5     1
I've been purchased, I've been pardoned, bound to Him I'm truly free!


1              4           1                1/5     5
I will sing of my Redeemer how He sought me while a slave
1                  4                1              5      1
Loosed me from the curse of sin and from the power of the grave


1              4    5       6-               4         5
I will sing of my Redeemer; lift my voice to praise my Lord
1               4         5      2-          5   1
Ransomed by His blood and mercy, I am His forevermore


1              4            1              1/5      5
I will sing of my Redeemer, He who bore my cross my curse
1               4                1             5         1
Came a servant, chose to suffer, lifted up and cast from earth


1              4            1              1/5        5
I will sing of my Redeemer; tell about the grace I've known
1                  4               1            5         1
Here on earth with those forgiven, and one day around His throne
