IN ALL YOUR WAYS

            1    5               4
In all your ways   acknowledge Him, 
            6-   4               5
In all your ways   acknowledge Him, 
            6-   6-/5   4                 1/3
In all your ways      acknowledge Him and say, 
   2m7                        5
“I trust You Lord with all my heart.”   (repeat chorus)
(2nd:
   2m7                 5      4/1  1
“I trust You Lord with all my heart.”)

And do not lean    on your understanding, 
           5    4  1
And do not lean    on your plans and schemes, 
           5    4    1
And do not lean   on self-preservation, 
2#M       6#M      5     2#M       6#M      5sus 5
Lean in - to   His love, lean in - to   His love.

And do not trust   your feelings of rejection, 
           5    4       1
And do not trust   your feelings of defeat, 
           5    4       1
And do not trust     in all your speculation, 
2#M       6#M          5      2#M            6#M     5sus 5
Trust the only One who leads, trust the only One who leads.
