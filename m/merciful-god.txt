Merciful God O abounding in love, faithful to all who draw near You.

Hearing the cries of the humble in heart, 
1           6-             5     1
Showing the cross they may cling to.

Father forgive, may my sin be remembered no more.


Merciful God, O abounding in love,
Faithful through times we have failed You.
Selfish in thought and uncaring in deed,
Foolish in word and ungrateful.
Spirit of God conquer our hearts,
With love that flows from forgiveness.
â€˜Cause us to yield and return to the mercy of God.



Merciful God, O abounding in love, 
Faithful to keep us from falling. 
Guiding our ways with Your fatherly heart,
Growing our faith with each testing.
God speed the day, struggles will end, 
Faultless we'll gaze on Your glory.
Then we will stand overwhelmed by the mercy of God
