MY EYES ARE DRY


   1        5       4        1
My eyes are dry, my faith is old.

   2-       6-       5       /6  /7
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold.

    1      5     4        1
And I know how I ought to be

 2-      6-      5       1
Alive to you and dead to me.


                4                          1
But what can be done for an old heart like mine.

          5               1
Soften it up with oil and wine.

           4                   1
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love.

                5                         1
Please wash me anew with the wine of Your blood.
