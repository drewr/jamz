THANKFUL
as recorded by Glen Phillips
transcribed by my aging ears and hands


INTRO:  | G     G/B  C |


G               G/B C      G       G/B C
Forgive me this sin,   I'm falling over

And flashing tin grins and rolling in clover

So ready to get out and eager to please

Well it's late in the day in the middle of a life, but it's early in the century


Bb
I never got it

C                   Eb        Cm7   Bb
I never got it before,   hey, hel - lo

Bb         F       Gm    Eb     Bb
Oh, how do you get on so much undone?

Bb           F     G
It's like it was before


   D          Em        C
We both got a lot to be thankful for

And we both got a lot to be thankful for



Forgive me my tongue, it doesn't know what it's doing
It used to get washed out, now it's undisciplined and crude
I'm losing my language and calling a truce
And the shape of the thoughts in my head
Aren't right for the words I've got to use

I got it never
Never got 'em before, hey, hello
Oh, how do you get on so much undone?
And still you shine like the sun

We both got a lot to be thankful for
And we both got a lot to be thankful for

A        A/C# D...
White dwarf,       red giant

It's empty in space and where there's matter there's violence


C
I never got it

D                      F    Dm7   C
I never got it before, hey, hel - lo

C          G       Am    F      C
Oh, how do you get on so much undone?


                             A
And still you shine like the sun
  E         F#m        D           A
We've got a lot to be thankful for
    E             F#m       D          G
And we both got a lot to be thankful for

G...
We both got a lot to be thankful for


We both got a lot to be thankful for

We both got a lot to be thankful for
