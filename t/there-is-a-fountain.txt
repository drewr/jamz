THERE IS A FOUNTAIN


     1               4        1                          5
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power,
     1                4         1               5      1
Till all the ransomed Church of God be saved to sin no more.
   1               4        1               5
Be saved to sin no more, be saved to sin no more.
     1                4                1        5      1
Till all the ransomed Church of God be saved to sin no more.



When this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song I’ll sing Thy power to save!
I’ll sing Thy power to save, I’ll sing Thy power to save.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I’ll sing Thy power to save!
