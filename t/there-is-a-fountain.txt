THERE IS A FOUNTAIN

      1             4           1                           5
There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
    1                 4          1                    5      1
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
     1                4            1                5d7
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;
    1                 4                     1/5       5      1
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.


The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away.
Washed all my sins away, washed all my sins away;
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away.


Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed Church of God be saved to sin no more.
Be saved to sin no more, be saved to sin no more.
Till all the ransomed Church of God be saved to sin no more.


E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.


When this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song I’ll sing Thy power to save!
I’ll sing Thy power to save, I’ll sing Thy power to save.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song I’ll sing Thy power to save!
