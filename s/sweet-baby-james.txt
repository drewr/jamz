      C          G         F            Em
There is a young cowboy he lives on the range

    Am            F              C       Em
His horse and his cattle are his only companions

   Am           F             C             Em
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons

F           C           G           Dm      G
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

    F                    G           C
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Am             F         C          G
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
    F                       G         C
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
Am             F             C            C
He sings out a song which is soft but its clear
   Dm       Am            G
As if maybe someone could hear

C             F         G     C
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Am       F          C
Rockabye sweet baby james
Am              F             C
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
         Am        Dm         G
Wont you let me go down in my dreams
    F        G          C
And rockabye sweet baby james

Now the first of december was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from stockbridge to boston
Lord, the berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

Theres a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
