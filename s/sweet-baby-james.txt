      1          5         4            3-
There is a young cowboy he lives on the range

    6-            4              1       3-
His horse and his cattle are his only companions

   6-           4             1             3-
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons

4           1           5           2-      5
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

    4                    5           1
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
6-             4         1          5
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
    4                       5         1
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
6-             4             1            1
He sings out a song which is soft but its clear
   2-       6-            5
As if maybe someone could hear

1             4         5     1
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
6-       4          1
Rockabye sweet baby james
6-              4             1
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
         6-        2-         5
Wont you let me go down in my dreams
    4        5          1
And rockabye sweet baby james

Now the first of december was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from stockbridge to boston
Lord, the berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

Theres a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
