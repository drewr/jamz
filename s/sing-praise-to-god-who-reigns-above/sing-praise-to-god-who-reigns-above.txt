The God of all cre - a - tion

The God of power, the God of love

The God of our sal - va - tion.

     3-            6-   2       5
With healing balm  my   soul He fills

    1               1  2   5
And every faithless murmur stills:

1/3  4       5          5sus  1     1/3 | 4  5  5sus | 1
To   God all praise and glo   ry.

What God’s almighty power hath made

6   2-             5  1
His gracious mercy keepeth,

   1               4       1
By morning glow or evening shade

6   2-                 5   1
His watchful eye ne’er sleepeth;

    3-         6-   2      5 
Within the kingdom  of His might,

    1               1   2  5
Lo! all is just and all is right:

1/3  4       5          5sus  1   1/3 | 4  (optionally: 4-7 to modulate down)
To   God all praise and glo   ry.

The Lord is never far away,

6   2-                  5    1
But through all grief distressing,

   1            4        1
An ever present help and stay,

6   2-                5   1
Our peace and joy and blessing.

   3-       6-     2      5
As with a mother’s tender hand,

   1                  1     2     5
He leads His own, His cho - sen   band

1/3 4       5          5sus  1  1/3 | 4  5  5sus |
To  God all praise and glo   ry.

Thus, all my toilsome way along,

I sing aloud His praises,

That men may hear the grateful song

My voice unwearied raises.

   3-        6-  2        5
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart,

     1             1    2     5
Both soul and body bear your  part:

1/3 4       5          5sus 1
To  God all praise and glo  ry.

1/3 4       5          5sus 1
To  God all praise and glo  ry.
