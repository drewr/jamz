Still, still, still, let all the world be still.
For Mary lays her son to rest,
Sings to him softly at her breast.
Still, still, still, let all the world be still.

Sleep, sleep, sleep, my dearest baby, sleep.
The angels all rejoice and sing,
Heav'n for your delight shall ring.
Sleep, sleep, sleep, my dearest baby, sleep.

Joy, joy, joy, my heart is filled with joy!
The God of love has left his throne,
Made this humble world his own.
Joy, joy, joy, my heart is filled with joy!
